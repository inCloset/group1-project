# Wine Quality Prediction üç∑

---

## Project Overview

This project predicts wine quality using machine learning based on physicochemical properties.

---

## Dataset

The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing red and white wine samples.

---

## Approach

	- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
	- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	- Model Training (RandomForest, SVM, etc.)
	- Hyperparameter Tuning
	- Evaluation & Optimization

---

## Results

	- Achieved 78% classification accuracy
	- Best Model: RandomForest with GridSearch tuning

---

## Future Work

	- Explore deep learning models
	- Use external datasets for better feature engineering
